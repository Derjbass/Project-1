# Project-1

In this project we created an application for movie searches

When the user searches for a movie they will see up to 3 responses for that title

Along with the title of the movie, the user will also see a poster for the movie, as long as the IMDB rating and an embedded link to the youtube trailer

We used two API's for this project, OTT for the title, poster, and IMDB rating, and Youtube for the trailer

Future Additions:

We would like to add links to streaming platforms where you can find the movies
